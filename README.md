# 21DaysofCodeChallenge
## Mission: Use code to center your mind in the COVID-19 (coronavirus) chaos while solving problems over the course of 21 days

Welcome to my 21 days of code challenge which was undertaken during the COVID-19 (coronavirus) period in order to distract myself from the chaos in the world. During the 21 days, I grabed a random problem from leetcode.com, and solved this using Python. This notebook includes the problems, solutions as well as links to the website from which the problems are copied. The cell for each day will contain all needed libraries. Feel free to attempt the problems yourself before checking out my solution.

All credit goes to leetcode.com for providing these problem sets.
